description: >
This plugin simplifies for your readers and you by making it easy to define terms or abbreviations that needs an explanation. Define a common dictionary of terms and their definition in a YAML file. Then inside markdown files you can use the provided glossary liquid tag to insert a tooltip for a defined word from the dictionary. The tooltip will show the term definition on mouse hover.

It's also possible to provide an optional URL to further term definition or source reference. To also support mobile devices, this URL link is placed inside the tooltip pop-up itself, rather than making the term itself clickable. This is so that on mobile device, you will first tap the word to get the hover tooltip, then click the link in the tooltip if desired.
